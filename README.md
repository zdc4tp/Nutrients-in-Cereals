# Nutrients-in-Cereals

The "80 Cereals" dataset contains dietary characteristic information on about 80 cereal products. Using the data set, we will be exploring the following 4 questions:

1. Which cereals in the dataset meet the FDA criteria for a healthy stamp based on saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars?
2. Are there any correlations between the shelf placement of cereals and their nutritional content?
3. Which manufacturers produce cereals with the highest average amount of fiber and potassium (FDA recommended nutrients to get more of) per serving?
4. Are there any trends or patterns in the nutritional content of cereals across different manufacturers?
