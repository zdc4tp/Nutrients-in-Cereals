The "80 Cereals" dataset contains dietary characteristic information on about 80 cereal products.

Columns:

* name (cereal name)
  + mfr (manufacturer)
  + A = American Home Food
  + G = General Mills
  + K = Kelloggs
  + N = Nabisco
  + P = Post
  + Q = Quaker Oats
  + R = Ralston Purina
* type
  + Cold
  + Hot
* calories (per serving)
* protein (grams of protein)
* fat (grams of fat)
* sodium (milligrams of sodium)
* fiber (grams of dietary fiber)
* carbo (grams of complex carbohydrates)
* sugars (grams of sugars)
* potass (milligrams of potassium)
* vitamins (vitamins and minerals; 0, 25, or 100, indicating the typical percentage of FDA recommended)
* shelf (display shelf; 1, 2, or 3, counting from the floor)
* weight (weight in ounces of one serving)
* cups (number of cups in one serving)
* rating (a rating of the cereals)

### Propsed questions:
1. Which cereals in the dataset meet the FDA criteria for a healthy stamp based on saturated fat, sodium, and added sugars?
2. Are there any correlations between the shelf placement of cereals and their nutritional content?
3. Which manufacturers produce cereals with the highest average amount of fiber and potassium (FDA recommended nutrients to get more of) per serving?
4. Are there any trends or patterns in the nutritional content of cereals across different manufacturers?
